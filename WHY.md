# Why am I building this?
This repository documents my long-overdue journey into the self-driven exploration of computational physics, using interactive visualizations to build deeper intuition for physical phenomena, which is something that's often overlooked or easy to miss when learning solely through traditional textbooks.

I have always harbored a keen fascination for how the universe works, not just in abstract mathematical terms, but in how physical principles quietly govern everyday events. Whether it's the parabolic arc of a tennis ball hit with a lot of topspin or the paperboy tossing a newspaper with the perfect force to land just at my neighbour's door, I often find myself trying to imagine these situations with the physics I have learned mentally.

This project is a way to bring those mental simulations to life. It is driven by a personal need to visualize, to see equations in motion (literally), and to experience the thrill of watching a few lines of Python code recreate how a satellite orbits the Earth, simply because nature dictates it should behave that way.

Along the way, this repository also helps me build stronger physical intuition, learn and understand the various numerical methods, and develop clean scientific programming skills that will serve me in research. But at its core, it exists to nurture that joy of seeing physics unfold.
